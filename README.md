## TorsionFit Examples

examples and data for `torsionfit`

### Manifest

* `data/` - includes Charmm forcefield and example (outdated) running torsionfit on pyrrole
* `synthetic_data/` - Toy model of 4 atoms to sample torsion parameters
* `butane/` - example of butane from generating QM torsion scan, sampler torsion parameters
and propagate error to hydration free energy
* `kinase_inhibitors/` - workflow for using `torsionfit` on a set of FDA approved Kinase inhibitors
